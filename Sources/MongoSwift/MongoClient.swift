     * Starts a `ChangeStream` on a `MongoClient`. Allows the client to observe all changes in a cluster -
     * excluding system collections and the "config", "local", and "admin" databases.
     *
     * - Parameters:
     *   - pipeline: An array of aggregation pipeline stages to apply to the events returned by the change stream.
     *   - options: An optional `ChangeStreamOptions` to use when constructing the change stream.
     *   - session: An optional `ClientSession` to use with this change stream.
     *
     * - Warning:
     *    If the returned change stream is alive when it goes out of scope, it will leak resources. To ensure the
     *    change stream is dead before it leaves scope, invoke `ChangeStream.kill(...)` on it.
     *
     * - Returns:
     *    An `EventLoopFuture<ChangeStream>`. On success, contains a `ChangeStream` watching all collections in this
     *    deployment.
     *
     *    If the future fails, the error is likely one of the following:
     *    - `MongoError.CommandError` if an error occurs on the server while creating the change stream.
     *    - `MongoError.InvalidArgumentError` if the options passed formed an invalid combination.
     *    - `MongoError.InvalidArgumentError` if the `_id` field is projected out of the change stream documents by the
     *      pipeline.
